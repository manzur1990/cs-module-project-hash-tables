# Use frequency analysis to find the key to ciphertext.txt, and then
# decode it.

# Your code here
'''
we create a function that takes a encrypted file  and outputs a decrypted message

what is frequency analysis?
    - 


1. create a list of letters that will map the key and values 

2. traverse through the list in where you look up 
the key and get as an output a value

3. we append the value to the list of decoded values
